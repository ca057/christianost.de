  h1 Hi! ðŸ‘‹
  
  p I'm Christian, a software developer from Bamberg in southern Germany. Currently I'm working as a fullstack developer for #[a(href="https://proxipedia.io", title="PROXIPEDIA") PROXIPEDIA], where I develop our mobile app, its GraphQL-server and the CMS for our customers.

  p I studied Inclusive Education at the KH Freiburg, focusing on how to support people with disabilites in their daily life. After writing an awesome bachelor thesis on the usage of Augmented Reality for supporting people with disabilities, I worked for half a year as an intern at the FTB, a research institue in the field of technology and disabilites. This brought me to Bamberg, where I studied Computing in the Humanities and began to work as a fullstack developer at PROXIPEDIA.

  p Refer to #[a(href="/cv", title="CV of Christian Ost") my CV] for more details or talk to me over a beer, wine or coffee.
