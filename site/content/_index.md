Hi! I’m a freelance software developer from Berlin focusing on building accessible and interactive web and mobile applications with the [SMO GmbH](https://www.smo.de/). Amongst others I was previously working on user interfaces for [Typeform](https://typeform.com) in Barcelona.

Do you have an exicting project?
