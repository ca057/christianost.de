This site does not use any form of tracking. The server-side access logs contain the IP address, date and time of the request, the HTTP request send, the referrer and the user agent. The IP address is redacted: For an IPv4 address only the first 16 bits are logged, for an IPv6 address only the first 32 bits. Additional information can be found in the [manual of uberspace](https://manual.uberspace.de/web-logs.html).
